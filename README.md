## Rev B (G2)
The second generation of the hardware is based on the first version of the hardware but we have made several improvements. It is a rechargeable battery-operated wireless sensor that can measure:

* Carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels
* Temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy
* Barometric pressure with 1 hPa absolute accuracy
* Humidity with ±3% accuracy
* Volatile organic compounds (VOC) gas sensor
* Tamper detection
* Sound level meter 

The project is described in our [Medium articles](https://medium.com/himinds/himinds-wireless-environmental-sensor-gen-2-part-1-requirements-37ee416b31b).

The enclosure is called CBRS01VWH and is made by [CamdenBoss](https://www.camdenboss.com/). 

## Rev A (G1)

The first version of the hardware, was based on the work done by OLIMEX. Link to their [project page](https://github.com/OLIMEX/ESP32-DevKit-LiPo)

## Open Source Hardware
The hardware is certified by OSHWA’s Open Source Hardware Certification program.
It is the first certification given to a Swedish project. 
* Rev A (Version 1.0) [OSHWA certification](https://certification.oshwa.org/se000001.html)
* Rev B (Version 2.0) [OSHWA certification](https://certification.oshwa.org/se000007.html)
